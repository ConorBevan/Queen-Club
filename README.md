## Testing 

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes. It allows the user to navigate around easily. All links work on the site also.
 

I have encountered several issues during testing.

I was having issues with my initial hamburger navigation menu for smaller devices, it was was overflowing onto my mian site because i had it off to the right at -200px at a medis query max-width of 850px. So when I would use a smaller screen to test it was overflowing so i chnaged this to -100%a and this fixed the issue on all screen sizes, no more overflowing onto my main page content.

When trying to send my conatact page to thnak you page it was not working, so
