## Testing 

I feel that the site has hit the goals required by all parties. The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes. Easy navigation. All links work on the site also.
 
I encountered one issue worth of notice.

I was having issues with my initial hamburger navigation menu for smaller devices, it was was overflowing onto my mian site because I had it off to the right at -200px at a media query max-width of 850px. So when I would test it out on smaller screen devices it overflowing so I changed this to -100% after a few attempts of fiddling round with the css code and this fixed the issue on all screen sizes, no more overflowing on any of my pages on the site.

Another issue I came across was I had a form action embeded within another form action which wouldn't allow my thank you page to work after submitting a contact form. But this issue was rectified after some research on how to fix this issue.
