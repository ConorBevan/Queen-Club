                    <h2 class="band-heading">The Beginning</h2>
                    <p class="band-history">The founding members of Queen met in West London during the late 1960s. Brian May had built
                        his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after Orwell's novel)
                         the following year. Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job as drummer. 
                         The band were originally known as Humpy Bong, after former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen, 
                         but later became known as Queen when they changed their surname to Mercury. 
                         They played their first gig in June 1970, playing covers of Cliff Richard's "Please Don't Tease" 
                         and other hits.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Early Years</h2>
                    <p class="band-history">John Deacon joined Queen as bassist n February 1971. In addition to being a seasoned bassist,
                        his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics. On 2 July, Queen 
                        played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey 
                        college. They recorded five of their own songs, "Liar", "Keep Yourself Alive", "Great King Rat", 
                        "The Night Comes Down" and "Jesus" at De Lane Lea Studios in Wembley. Co-producers Anthony and 
                        Baker initially clashed with the band on the direction of the album. "Mad the Swine" was dropped 
                        from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix. Mike Stone created the 
                        final mix for "Keep Yourself Alive", and he would go on to work on several other Queen albums.
                        Queen's second album Queen II was released in March 1973. It reached number five on the British 
                        album chart and was the first Queen album to chart in the UK. The album featured a 'layered' 
                        sound which would become their signature. It is the first of three Queen albums to feature in 
                        the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Crossing International Waters</h2>
                    <p class="band-history">
                        Queen's third album, Sheer Heart Attack, was released in 1974. It was their first taste of 
                        international success, and went gold in the US. Mercury wrote the closing number, "In the Lap
                        of the Gods", with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played
                        live. In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in "The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever". 
                        In January 1975, Queen toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time. The
                        band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. Despite the success, Queen were
                        still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. In August, after an acrimonious split with
                        Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A Night at the Opera was Queen's most expensive album, costing £40,000 and using three
                        different studios. Mercury wrote the opening song "Death on Two Legs", a savage dig at
                        perceived wrongdoers, and the camp vaudeville "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon" and "Seaside
                        Rendezvous". May's epic "The Prophet's Song" was an eight-minute epic; the middle section
                        is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. Mercury's close
                        friend and advisor, Capital London DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving
                        the single exposure. It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK,
                        surpassed only by Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" and Elton John's
                        "Candle in the Wind".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        "Bohemian Rhapsody" was promoted with a music video directed by Bruce Gowers, who had already
                        shot several of Queen's live concerts. Filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, the video
                        cost £3,500, five times the typical promotional budget, and was shot in three hours. The
                        operatic section featured a reprise of the Queen II cover, with the band member's heads
                        animated. A Night at the Opera was released in 1975 and went triple platinum in the United
                        States. The second single from the album was Deacon's "You're My Best Friend", which 
                        peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and went on to become a worldwide
                        top-ten hit. It is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book 1001 
                        Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">The Startdom Continued</h2>
                     <p class="band-history">By 1976, Queen were back in the studio recording A Day at the Races. It again borrowed the name of
                        a Marx Brothers movie, and its cover was similar to that of A Night at the Opera. The
                        band self-produced with assistance from Mike Stone, who performed backing vocals. The major hit
                        on the album was "Somebody to Love", a gospel-inspired song in which Mercury, May, and Taylor
                        multi-tracked their voices to create a gospel choir. Queen performed sold-out shows at Madison
                        Square Garden and Earls Court in 1977. Mercury and Taylor used a lighting rig in the shape
                        of a crown for the first time, costing £50,000 to install. The band's sixth studio album
                        News of the World was released in 1977, which has gone four times platinum in the United
                        States, and twice in the UK. In 1978, Queen released Jazz, which reached number two in
                        the UK and number six on the Billboard 200 in the US. "Crazy Little Thing Called Love",
                        a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley, was the band's first
                        number one single in the United States. Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing
                        the song live, the first time he ever played guitar in concert.</p>

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Worldwide Tours</h2>
                     <p class="band-history">Queen began their 1980s career with The Game. It featured the singles "Crazy Little Thing Called
                        Love" and "Another One Bites the Dust", both of which reached number one in the US. It was also
                        the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. In 1980, Queen also released the
                        soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon. Queen were the first major rock band to play
                        significant shows in Latin America. One of their concerts in Argentina drew the largest single
                        concert crowd in Argentine history with an audience of 300,000. The group's second show at
                        the Vélez Sarsfield Stadium in Buenos Aires was broadcast on national television and watched
                        by over 30 million. Backstage, the group were introduced to footballer Diego Maradona. 
                        Mercury would stop singing and conduct the audience as they took over, with Lesley-Ann
                        Jones writing "the fans knew the song by heart". The ballad "Love of My Life" stole
                        the show in South American concerts. Queen worked with David Bowie on the 1981 single
                        "Under Pressure" Mercury finished the final gig saying, "Adios, amigos,
                        you motherfucksers!". 1982, Queen released the album Hot Space, a departure from their
                        trademark seventies sound, this time being a mixture of pop rock, dance, disco, funk,
                        and R&B. Most of the album was recorded in Munich during the most turbulent period in the
                        band's history. Q magazine would list Hot Space as one of the top fifteen albums where great
                        rock acts lost the plot. The band stopped touring North America after their Hot Space
                        Tour, as their success there had waned. Their fall in popularity in the US has been
                        partially attributed to a homophobia. "They didn't like this identity of Mercury—what
                        they perceived as a brazenly gay rock & roll hero"

                    <h2 class="band-heading">That Live Aid Moment</h2>
                     <p class="band-history">In January 1985, Queen headlined two nights of the first Rock in Rio festival at Rio de Janeiro,
                        Brazil. Highlights from both nights were released on VHS as Queen: Live in Rio. An industry poll
                        in 2005 ranked it the greatest rock performance of all time. At Live Aid, Queen performed some
                        of their greatest hits in front of an estimated 1.9 billion people. In December 2013, Queen's
                        recording studio was opened to the public for the first time. Fans were asked to donate
                        to the Mercury Phoenix Trust charity in exchange for access to the band's archives.
                        In 1985, Queen recorded the album A Kind of Magic, which was successful in the UK and 
                        Germany but less so in North America. In 1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final 
                        tour with Freddie Mercury. The Magic Tour's highlight was at Wembley Stadium and resulted
                        in the live double album Queen at Wembley. More than one million people saw Queen on the
                        tour—400,000 in the UK alone, a record at the time. At Knebworth Park, over 120,000
                        fans packed the park for what was Queen's final performance with Mercury.</p>

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Mercurys Final Years</h2>
                     <p class="band-history">Mercury was diagnosed with HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public until 1988.
                        The Miracle spawned the hit singles "I Want It All" and "The Miracle", which became an
                        anti-apartheid anthem in South Africa. In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and
                        signed with Hollywood Records; they were soon being distributed by Disney. Queen's 1991 album
                        Innuendo is one of the best-selling albums of all time and has sold 16 million copies
                        worldwide. The single "The Show Must Go On", released as a forerunner to Greatest Hits II,
                        featured archive footage of Queen's performances between 1981 and 1989. Mercury was
                        increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded "Innuendo", but singer
                        Brian May says he "completely killed it". "Bohemian Rhapsody" was re-released as a single
                        shortly after Mercury's death, with "These Are the Days of Our Lives" as the double
                        A-side. The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks.
                        Initial proceeds from the single—approximately £1,000,000—were donated to the
                        Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity. In 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert
                        was held at London's Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 72,000.</p>

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Queen Today</h2>
                     <p class="band-history">Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before
                        the festival was cancelled. Queen also performed with Lambert on 3 July 2012 at Moscow's Olympic
                        Stadium and in Wroclaw, Poland. On 20 September 2013, Queen performed at the iHeartRadio Music
                        Festival at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. One new track, "There Must Be More to
                        Life Than This", is a duet between Mercury and Michael Jackson. Queen + Adam Lambert performed
                        in the shadow of Big Ben in Central Hall, Westminster, central London at the Big Ben New
                        Year concert on New Year's Eve 2014 and 2015. The Queen have released a live album with
                        Adam Lambert titled Live Around the World. In 2016, the group embarked across Europe 
                        and Asia on the Queen + Adam Lambert 2016 Summer Festival Tour. This included closing 
                        the Isle of Wight Festival in June where they performed "Who Wants to Live Forever" as
                        a tribute to the victims of the Orlando shooting. The band toured North America in the 
                        summer of 2017 and toured Europe in late 2017.

                    <br>
                        On 24 February 2019, Queen + Adam Lambert opened the 91st Academy Awards ceremony held at the Dolby
                        Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. In July 2019 they embarked on the North American leg of
                        The Rhapsody Tour, with the dates sold out in April.They toured Japan and South Korea in 
                        January 2020 followed by Australia and New Zealand the following month. On 16
                        February the band reprised their Live Aid set for the first time in 35 years at the Fire
                        Fight Australia concert at ANZ Stadium in Sydney to raise money for the 2019 Australian
                        bushfire crisis. Because Queen were not able to tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they
                        released a live album with Adam Lambert on 2 October 2020. The 20-plus song collection,
                        titled Live Around the World, contains personally selected highlights by the band members 
                        from over 200 shows throughout their history. It marked their first live album with Lambert
                        who, as of 2020, has played 218 shows with the band. On 31 December 2020, Queen
                        performed on the Japanese New Year's Eve television special Kōhaku with composer Yoshiki
                        and vocalist Sarah Brightman. In 2021 Queen received the Japan Gold Disc Award
                        for the fourth time (having previously won it in 2005, 2019 and 2020) as
                        the most popular Western act in Japan. On 4 June 2022, Queen + Alan Lambert opened
                        the Platinum Party at the Palace outside Buckingham Palace to mark the Queen's Platinum
                        Jubilee. Performing a three-song set, they opened with "We Will Rock You" which
                        had been introduced in a comedy segment where Queen Elizabeth II and Paddington Bear 
                        tapped their tea cups to the beat of the song.
