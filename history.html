                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The founding members of Queen met in West London during the late 1960s. Brian May had built
                        his own guitar with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after Orwell's novel)
                         the following year. Roger Taylor, a young dental student, auditioned and got the job as drummer. 
                         The band were originally known as Humpy Bong, after former Bee Gees drummer Colin Petersen, 
                         but later became known as Queen when they changed their surname to Mercury. 
                         They played their first gig in June 1970, playing covers of Cliff Richard's "Please Don't Tease" 
                         and other hits.

                    <h2>Early Years</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>John Deacon joined Queen as bassist n February 1971. In addition to being a seasoned bassist,
                        his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics. On 2 July, Queen 
                        played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey 
                        college. They recorded five of their own songs, "Liar", "Keep Yourself Alive", "Great King Rat", 
                        "The Night Comes Down" and "Jesus" at De Lane Lea Studios in Wembley. Co-producers Anthony and 
                        Baker initially clashed with the band on the direction of the album. "Mad the Swine" was dropped 
                        from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix. Mike Stone created the 
                        final mix for "Keep Yourself Alive", and he would go on to work on several other Queen albums.
                        Queen's second album Queen II was released in March 1973. It reached number five on the British 
                        album chart and was the first Queen album to chart in the UK. The album featured a 'layered' 
                        sound which would become their signature. It is the first of three Queen albums to feature in 
                        the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Queen's third album, Sheer Heart Attack, was released in 1974. It was their first taste of 
                        international success, and went gold in the US. Mercury wrote the closing number, "In the Lap
                         of the Gods", with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played
                          live. In 2006, Classic Rock ranked it number 28 in "The 100 Greatest British Rock Albums Ever". 
                          In January 1975, Queen toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time. The
                           band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. Despite the success, Queen were
                            still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. In August, after an acrimonious split with
                             Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract.
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             A Night at the Opera was Queen's most expensive album, costing £40,000 and using three
                              different studios. Mercury wrote the opening song "Death on Two Legs", a savage dig at
                               perceived wrongdoers, and the camp vaudeville "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon" and "Seaside
                                Rendezvous". May's epic "The Prophet's Song" was an eight-minute epic; the middle section
                                is a canon, with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. Mercury's close
                                 friend and advisor, Capital London DJ Kenny Everett, played a pivotal role in giving
                                  the single exposure. It is the third-best-selling single of all time in the UK,
                                   surpassed only by Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" and Elton John's
                                    "Candle in the Wind".
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            "Bohemian Rhapsody" was promoted with a music video directed by Bruce Gowers, who had already
                             shot several of Queen's live concerts. Filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, the video
                              cost £3,500, five times the typical promotional budget, and was shot in three hours. The
                               operatic section featured a reprise of the Queen II cover, with the band member's heads
                                animated. A Night at the Opera was released in 1975 and went triple platinum in the United
                                 States. The second single from the album was Deacon's "You're My Best Friend", which 
                                 peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and went on to become a worldwide
                                  top-ten hit. It is the third and final Queen album to be featured in the book 1001 
                                  Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
