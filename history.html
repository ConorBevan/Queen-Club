                    <h2 class="band-heading">The Beginning</h2>
                    <p class="band-history">In 1968, Astronomy student and guitarist Brian May and bass player
                        Tim Staffell, both students at Imperial College, decided they wanted to form a group.
                        Brian placed an advertisement on the college notice board for a “Ginger Baker type” drummer, 
                        and a young dental student called Roger Taylor auditioned and got the job. They called the group 
                        “Smile”.Smile were signed to Mercury Records in 1969, and had their first experience recording at
                        Trident Studios that year. Tim Staffell was at Ealing College of Art with Freddie Mercury (then 
                        Freddie Bulsara), and introduced him to the band. Freddie soon became a keen fan. Sadly, in 1970, 
                        “Smile” decided to call it a day, as nothing seemed to be happening for them. Tim went off and 
                        joined a band called Humpty Bong.Freddie left his band “Wreckage” and joined up with Brian and 
                        Roger - it had all begun. Freddie changed his name by deed poll to Mercury, changed the band's 
                        name to “Queen”, and John Deacon was asked to audition as their bass playe. In February 1971, 
                        John Deacon was taken on as the fourth member of Queen.The band rehearsed tirelessly and played 
                        several small gigs at Imperial College. Then they were offered the chance to 'test' a new 
                        recording studio called De Lane Lea. In return for trying out the new equipment, they could also 
                        make free demo tapes. They signed a recording contract and publishing and management agreements 
                        with Trident in 1972, and during that year were paid just £60 per week. Queen were given the 
                        “down time” (out of hours studio time) at Trident Studios, where they began work on their first 
                        album.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Early Years</h2>
                    <p class="band-history">In 1973, Trident and EMI signed a contract for a recording deal for Queen, 
                        and July of that year saw the release of " Queen", their first album. The band were offered a big 
                        break - their first major tour as support band to Mott The Hoople. It began in Leeds in November 
                        1973, and it was said by many people during that tour that 'Queen were more than a support 
                        act ....' "Queen II" was finally released in March 1974 - it should have been earlier, but there 
                        was a minor printing error on the sleeve that Queen insisted on having corrected! The band 
                        embarked on their first headlining tour of Britain, starting in Blackpool in March 1974. In April 
                        1974, the band embarked on their first-ever USA tour as guests to Mott The Hoople. But in May of 
                        that year, whilst on tour, Brian collapsed with hepatitis, and the band had to cancel the rest of 
                        their dates.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Work on their third album began without Brian and with a lot of help from Roy Thomas Baker. Brian 
                        finally felt well enough to go into the studios to record his guitar parts, although he was still 
                        ill and spend much time between takes in the studio bathroom being very sick! But eventually, the 
                        album was finished, and " Sheer Heart Attack" was released in November 1974. It was a huge hit 
                        both sides of the Atlantic.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Crossing International Waters</h2>
                    <p class="band-history-video">In January 1975, Queen left for the USA on their very first headlining 
                        tour. Ticket sales were phenomenal, and demand was so high that they had to add more shows, doing 
                        two shows in one day at some venues, both shows being sold out. Quite a few shows on that tour 
                        had to be cancelled, as Freddie had developed a severe throat problem, but he soldiered on and performed 
                        as many as possible, although doctors had advised him against it. Also in January 1975, Queen engaged the
                        services of a Music Business lawyer, Jim Beach, to negotiate them out of their Trident agreements, as 
                        Trident were no longer being as supportive as they should have been, and the band were unhappy with the 
                        situation. Their first Canadian gig was in Edmonton on April 2nd, where they were joined on stage by support
                        act Kansas. April of '75 saw Queen set to pay their first-ever visit to Japan.When they arrived 
                        at the airport, there were over three thousand fans there to greet them, as Sheer Heart Attack 
                        was Number One in Japan at the time. It was a scene reminiscent of Beatlemania in the Sixties.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Queen began work on their new album in June 1975. Links with Trident were finally severed - to 
                        the band's great relief - in August, and by September Queen had signed with new management: enter 
                        John Reid. When the band decided to release Bohemian Rhapsody in 1975, everyone told them it was 
                        far too long and just would not be a hit at 5 minutes and 55 seconds. But Freddie gave a copy of 
                        the single to friend and London DJ Kenny Everett, informing him that it was for him personally, 
                        and that he must not play it on air. But of course he did - fourteen times in two days!! From 
                        then on, every major radio station played the song in full, and not edited versions as was first 
                        thought. It was a colossal hit, and really established Queen as THE band of the era. The single 
                        stayed at Number One for nine weeks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When "A Night At The Opera" was released in November 1975, it was a massive hit, and gave them 
                        their first platinum album. Freddie had designed a Queen logo for the " Queen" album, which was 
                        re-worked and used as the cover for "A Night At The Opera". The now-famous 'crest' features the 
                        band's star signs - two fairies for Virgo, a crab for Cancer and two lions for the two Leos. 
                        In January 1976, the band set off on their third American tour, which took them all over America 
                        and continued until the end of March. They then flew direct to Japan, arriving yet again to a 
                        riotous reception. By this time, all four Queen albums were in the UK Top Twenty, which was an 
                        unheard-of feat. They undertook an extensive tour of Japan, and then flew on to Australia. 
                        Their tour 'Down Under' began at the Perth Entertainment Centre.They flew back to the UK to 
                        begin work on their next album, "A Day At The Races", but recording was halted while the band
                        took off on a short UK tour. On September 18th, 1976, Queen decided they wanted to say thanks 
                        to their dedicated fans, and so - in true extravagant style - they staged a huge free concert 
                        in London's Hyde Park. The crowds were estimated at between 150 and 200 thousand people - the 
                        largest audience Queen had played to up to that time, and to date still the highest-ever 
                        attendance record for a concert in Hyde Park.

                        <br>
                        In February 1978, Queen decided they should set up their own management structure. They parted 
                        company with John Reid more amicably than their split with Trident - this severance agreement 
                        was actually signed in the back of Freddie's Rolls Royce during a break in filming "We Will Rock 
                        You" in the back garden of Roger's house in Surrey! A short (by Queen standards!) tour of Europe 
                        began in April 1978 - again in Stockholm. In July, the band started work on their new album. They 
                        recorded it in Montreux and France - the first time they had ever recorded outside Great Britain.
                        At the end of 1979 found Queen embarking on 'The Crazy Tour'. It included such illustrious venues 
                        as Tiffany's in Purley, the Lewisham Odeon, Alexandra Palace, and finally, the Hammersmith Odeon. 
                        They were one of many bands who performed at the venue to raise money for the starving people of 
                        Kampuchea. During that Crazy Tour, the band's tour manager, Gerry Stickells, collapsed backstage 
                        and had to be rushed to hospital. Gerry had been with Queen on every tour since 1976.

                    <h2 class="band-heading">Worldwide Tours</h2>
                     <p class="band-history-video">At the end of 1980, Queen had sold over 45,000,000 albums worldwide.
                         In February 1981, after another Far East tour, the band flew to Rio de Janeiro for the start 
                         of their first tour of South America. Queen were the first rock band to undertake a stadium 
                         tour of South America, paving the way for many more bands to follow. The band's equipment had 
                         to be flown in a privately hired 'Flying Tiger' 747 cargo plane from Tokyo - the flight between 
                         Tokyo and Buenos Aires is the longest air route between capital cities in the world.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         Their first South American gig was Buenos Aires, on February 28th 1981. They then filled three 
                         more Argentinean World Cup soccer stadiums, playing five sold-out stadium gigs in just eight 
                         days. They then played two nights at the massive Morumbi Stadium in Sao Paolo. On the first 
                         night, 131,000 people attended, and Queen created rock & roll history as it was the largest 
                         paying audience for a single band anywhere in the world. During those two nights at the Morumbi 
                         Stadium, 251,000 people saw the Queen spectacle - that's a larger audience than most bands can 
                         expect in their whole career. Every single one of Queen's albums was in the Top Ten in Argentina 
                         during their tour.Whilst they were in Sao Paulo, the band celebrated the fact that the single, 
                         'Love Of My Life', had been in the Sao Paulo singles chart for over 12 consecutive months. 
                         In April 1981, Roger released his first solo album, titled " Fun In Space". Queen were back in 
                         South America - it was a return trip, being hailed as 'The Gluttons For Punishment Tour'! 
                         Unfortunately, their last two gigs in Caracas had to be canceled after former Venezuelan 
                         President Rómulo Betancourt died. So the band moved on to play in Mexico, in Monterrey and 
                         Puebla - just outside Mexico City. Whilst there, the band's promoter, Jose Rota, was arrested 
                         and jailed. Jim Beach had to pay over $25,000 bail money to release him so the tour could 
                         continue.

                     <p class="band-history-video">July 13, 1985, was a day that went down in history as the “Live Aid” 
                        concert took the world by storm from London's vast Wembley Stadium (where Queen performed) 
                        and from Philadelphia in the USA. Queen were just one of a multitude of top bands who all 
                        performed a short, 20-minute set. The world was watching, and Queen were unanimously voted - by 
                        press and public alike - as the band that stole the show. That event was a turning point for 
                        Queen. In 1986, Queen went on the Magic Tour, their final tour with Freddie Mercury. 
                        The Magic Tour's highlight was at Wembley Stadium and resulted in the live double album 
                        Queen at Wembley. More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the UK alone, 
                        a record at the time. At Knebworth Park, over 120,000fans packed the park for what was Queen's 
                        final performance with Mercury.

                     <p class="band-history">Mercury was diagnosed with HIV positive in 1987, but did not make his illness public until 1988.
                        The Miracle spawned the hit singles "I Want It All" and "The Miracle", which became an
                        anti-apartheid anthem in South Africa. In 1990, Queen ended their contract with Capitol and
                        signed with Hollywood Records; they were soon being distributed by Disney. Queen's 1991 album
                        Innuendo is one of the best-selling albums of all time and has sold 16 million copies
                        worldwide. The single "The Show Must Go On", released as a forerunner to Greatest Hits II,
                        featured archive footage of Queen's performances between 1981 and 1989. Mercury was
                        increasingly ill and could barely walk when the band recorded "Innuendo", but singer
                        Brian May says he "completely killed it". "Bohemian Rhapsody" was re-released as a single
                        shortly after Mercury's death, with "These Are the Days of Our Lives" as the double
                        A-side. The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks.
                        Initial proceeds from the single—approximately £1,000,000—were donated to the
                        Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity. In 1992, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert
                        was held at London's Wembley Stadium to a crowd of 72,000.</p>
